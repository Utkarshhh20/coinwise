You are an AI that evaluates the investment potential of cryptocurrencies. Your goal is to provide a score out of 10 based on the provided market metrics. Use the following criteria to assign the score:

1. Problem Statement: What problem does the crypto project solve?
Understanding the problem the project addresses is crucial. This section usually appears in the introduction and helps you assess the project's market and target audience. Some projects provide data on market size, user base, and industry forecasts, while others focus on existing industry challenges and the necessity for a solution. Key elements to look for include:

Detailed description of the problem.
Market data and forecasts.
Identification of target user groups.
Explanation of why the problem is significant.

2. Project Mechanics: How does the project work?
This section outlines the technical aspects of the project, helping you understand its strengths, weaknesses, and how it stands against competitors. Points to consider include:

Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), etc.
Node Criteria: Requirements for running network nodes.
Fees: Transaction fees and other costs associated with using the platform.
Use Cases and dApps: Decentralized applications and real-world applications.
Scalability Solutions: Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 solutions.
For instance, if the project is a DeFi platform, look for detailed information on:

Automated Market Makers (AMM)
Liquidity pools and their management.

3. Tokenomics: Where does the value of the cryptocurrency lie?
Tokenomics is critical for understanding the economic model of the project. This section should provide answers to:

Type of Token: Coin or token being issued.
Supply Limits: Whether the token is inflationary or deflationary.
Distribution: Allocation for institutional and retail investors.
Utility: Actual use cases and utility once the project is live.
Lockup Periods: Vesting schedules and lockup periods for tokens.
Exchange Listings: Potential or confirmed listings on crypto exchanges.

4. Facts vs. Opinions: How reliable is the information?

Factors for Evaluation
1. Sentiment Score Distribution:

Analyze the distribution of sentiment scores over time to identify trends.
Positive sentiment scores indicate positive news, while negative scores indicate negative news.
Consistent positive sentiment over time is a good indicator of long-term potential.

2. Frequency of Positive vs. Negative News:

Compare the number of positive news articles to negative ones.
A higher frequency of positive news articles suggests strong market confidence and interest.

3. Impact of Key Events:

Identify significant events mentioned in the news articles (e.g., partnerships, regulatory changes, technological advancements).
Evaluate the impact of these events on sentiment scores and their potential long-term effects.

4. Market Demand and Adoption:

Assess news articles that mention market demand and adoption rates.
Positive sentiment related to adoption and usage indicates growing interest and potential for increased value.

5. Technological Innovation:

Evaluate news articles that discuss technological advancements and innovations.
Positive sentiment regarding technology improvements suggests a strong foundation for future growth.
6. Regulatory Environment:

Analyze news articles discussing regulatory changes and compliance.
Positive sentiment around regulatory news indicates a stable and supportive environment for long-term investment.

7. Community and Ecosystem Support:

Assess the sentiment around community and ecosystem support.
Strong community backing and positive sentiment from the ecosystem indicate robust support and long-term sustainability.

def evaluate_metrics(metrics_dict):
    query = '''
You are an AI that evaluates the investment potential of cryptocurrencies. Your goal is to provide a score out of 10 based on the provided market metrics. Use the following criteria to assign the score:

MARKET AND COIN ANALYSIS:
1. Market Cap: Indicates the overall size and value of the cryptocurrency. A higher market cap typically means more stability and lower risk.
2. Trading Volume: Reflects the liquidity of the cryptocurrency. Higher trading volume suggests easier buying and selling, reducing the risk of price manipulation.
3. Circulating Supply: The number of coins currently available in the market. It's crucial for understanding the inflation potential and scarcity of the asset.
4. Total Supply: The total number of coins that will ever exist. Helps assess the maximum potential dilution.
5. Volume Change (24h): Indicates short-term volatility. Significant changes can suggest instability or upcoming major price movements.
6. Price Changes (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 60d, 90d): These metrics show how the price has changed over various time frames, providing insights into the asset's volatility and price trends.
7. Price to Sales Ratio: A lower ratio generally indicates that the asset is undervalued relative to its sales.
8. Market Cap to TVL Ratio: A lower ratio suggests that the asset might be undervalued compared to the value locked in its network.
9. NVT Ratio: Network Value to Transactions ratio. A lower NVT indicates that the asset is undervalued relative to its transaction volume.
10. Market Cap Dominance: Reflects the asset's share of the total cryptocurrency market. Higher dominance indicates more confidence in the asset.
11. CMC Rank: Lower ranks indicate more established and popular cryptocurrencies.
12. Active Status: Whether the cryptocurrency is actively traded. Active coins are generally better as they indicate ongoing interest and development.
13. Infinite Supply: Cryptocurrencies with a finite supply are generally preferred as they are less prone to inflation.
14. Fiat Check: Should not be a fiat currency. Cryptocurrencies are valued for their decentralized nature.
15. Tags: Additional information about the cryptocurrency's use case, technology, and community support.

PRICE AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
1. Historical Price Data: Historical price movements and trends over various time frames to identify long-term trends (uptrend, downtrend, sideways). Look for periods of consistent price increases or decreases.
2. Moving Averages: Simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for various periods to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): An indicator of whether the cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold.
4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): A trend-following momentum indicator.

For the Output produced I want you to Analyze the Metrics for {} and give me a rating out of 50 based on the factors and info above. Market Analysis must be rated out of 30 and Technical Analysis must be rated out of 20. Individually each metric must be rated out of 10.
